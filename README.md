# Exno.7-Develop a prompt-based application tailored to their personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

## Register no: 212222060003
# Aim: 
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.
# Explanation: 
## Prompt:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
## Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)
Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.

## PROCEDURE:
### 1. UNDERSTANDING THE BASICS OF AI AUDIO GENERATION:
• Study the fundamentals and architecture of audio synthesis models using AI.
• Explore the capabilities and input requirements of prominent tools like:
o Suno AI
o Google MusicLM
o Meta’s MusicGen
(Note: OpenAI’s Jukedeck platform is deprecated and unavailable for current
usage.)
• These models typically accept textual prompts and in some cases reference audio to
generate outputs like:
o Instrumental music
o Sound effects
o Human-like speech
### 2. GENERATING AUDIO WITH NAIVE PROMPTS:
• Use basic, minimal-context prompts to examine how the model handles default
instructions.
### • Example Prompt:
"Generate relaxing background music."
• Observation: Output may lack specific musical structure or instrument usage.
### 3. CREATING REFINED PROMPTS:
• Enhance prompts with structured descriptors to guide the model.
• Include details like:
o Genre
o Instruments
o Mood or tone
o Tempo (BPM)
o Target use case
### • Example Refined Prompt:
"Generate a 3-minute ambient track with soft piano, light acoustic guitar, and subtle
ocean wave sounds. It should have a slow tempo (60 BPM) and be suitable for
meditation."
### 4. INTERACTIVE PROMPTING AND CUSTOMIZATION:
• Iteratively build the audio piece with multi-turn feedback.
• Use additional prompts to modify previously generated segments.
### • Example Prompt:
"Add a soft violin layer in the second half of the music to increase emotional depth."
• Benefit: Enables progressive refinement and layered composition.
### 5. SPEECH AND VOICE GENERATION:
• Use text-to-speech models to synthesize human-like speech.
• Customize based on voice tone, gender, pacing, and emotion.
### • Example Prompt:
"Generate a female voice with a warm tone saying: 'Welcome to our relaxation
podcast. Let’s take a deep breath and begin.'"
• Tools used may include:
o Google’s TTS API
o Amazon Polly
o ElevenLabs (for voice cloning)
### 6. GENERATING SOUND EFFECTS:
• Generate specific environment-based or action-based audio using descriptive prompts.
### • Example Prompt:
"Generate the sound of rain falling on a tin roof during a thunderstorm."
• Useful for:
o Game development
o Video post-production
o Ambient sound libraries
### 7. MULTIMODAL INPUT (ADVANCED):
• Leverage tools that support text + audio input.
• Upload a rhythm sample or melody loop and direct the model with textual
instructions.
### • Example Prompt:
"Use the rhythm of [uploaded drum loop] and generate an energetic electronic track
with synth melodies."
• Note: Requires platforms with multimodal capabilities like Suno AI (Pro) or
Magenta Studio.
### 8. PROMPT OPTIMIZATION:
• Experiment with variations of prompts to identify how small changes impact
generation.
• Compare these:
o "Fast-paced upbeat pop music"
o "Upbeat pop music with clapping and synthesizer beats, 120 BPM"
• Insight: More specific prompts lead to higher alignment with user intent.
### DELIVERABLES:
1. SET OF PROMPTS (BASIC TO ADVANCED):

### 2. GENERATED AUDIO OUTPUTS:
Note: Due to current tool limitations or lack of access, actual audio generation was not
performed. Expected outputs are based on prompt design and AI model behavior.
• Prompt:
"Generate a calm and soothing background music for relaxation, in the style of
classical piano music."
• Expected Output (Description):
A mellow instrumental track featuring soft piano melodies with a slow tempo (~60
BPM), evoking calm and introspection. Minimal ambient layers may be added for
depth, suitable for meditation apps or wellness content.

## CONCLUSION:
Through systematic exploration of prompt engineering techniques for AI audio generation,
this experiment demonstrated how descriptive, structured, and iterative prompting can
significantly enhance the quality, emotional tone, and usefulness of generated audio. Whether
for music, speech, or environmental sound effects, AI tools respond more effectively to
detailed prompts—allowing users to fine-tune outputs for specific creative or commercial
applications.
This experiment underscores the creative potential of AI in sound design, the importance of
prompt clarity, and the growing relevance of multimodal audio generation in the field of
digital media production.

# Result: 
The lab exercise resulted in the creation of a prototype concept for a personal assistant powered by large language model.
